# GWTC-maps


Localization maps of LVK GW sources. 

The maps from GWTC-1, GWTC-2, GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 are combined into Data/maps/maps.npy and their headers are stored in Data/maps/dicts.npy.

The original maps are in nested-ordered healpix format, with $nside = 2048$, and are in equatorial system. We have downsampled them to $nside = 64$.
